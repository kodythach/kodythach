This single page application takes simulates the game 'Scrabble' using
one strip of the game. The user is given a rack containing 7 letters,
and the user must drag each of these letters onto the scrabble strip
to form a word. If the word is valid (exists in the dictionary), the
user will be allowed to submit the word to receive a score towards
the score counter. If invalid, the submit button will be greyed out and
the user will not be able to click on it. There also exists a restart
button should the user want to completely restart the game of scrabble.
The tile counter is there to indicate how many tiles are available for
the user to use.
